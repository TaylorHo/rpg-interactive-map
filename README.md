# RPG Interactive Map

[[Preview]](https://taylorho.github.io/rpg-interactive-map/)

An interactive map for tabletop RPGs and fantasy worlds! This project leverages [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and the [leaflet-sidebar](https://github.com/Turbo87/leaflet-sidebar) plugin to create an engaging and dynamic map experience. 

Users can load a fantasy map, add custom markers using a CSV file, and view detailed information about locations through a sidebar.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Pan, zoom, and explore fantasy maps rendered with Leaflet.js.
- **Custom Markers:** Define different types of markers via a CSV file for easy customization and management.
- **Sidebar Information:** Click on a marker to open a sidebar with detailed information about the selected location.
- **Flexible Map Integration:** Create maps using popular tools and split them for use in Leaflet.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prepare Your Map

To use a custom fantasy map:
1. Create your map using tools like [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/) or [Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator](https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/).
2. Split the map into tiles for Leaflet compatibility using the [maptiles](https://github.com/jahed/maptiles) tool:
   ```bash
   ./maptiles my-map.jpeg ./output-folder --square
   ```

### 2. Add Markers

Markers are loaded dynamically from a CSV file. Take a look at the [`locations.csv`](./locations.csv) file
This CSV file have the following columns:
- **category**: Any text, the togable layers will be groups of categories with the same name.
- **overlayMarkerColor**: Color for the bullet shown before the layer name, in the layer groups. It's useful to use the same color as your markers. If you want a new color, you can add it in `styles.css` (we currently have yellow, green, purple, red, blue, darkblue and lightblue, to match the current custom markers colors).
- **lat**: Latitude of the marker.
- **long**: Longitude of the marker.
- **icon**: The name of the marker, same name as it have in `js/icons.js` file.
- **text**: Name of the marker.
- **description**: Content of the sidebar that is shown after clicking the marker. It can have HTML tags and as many commas as you want. If you want to open it into a CSV/Excel editor, make sure to add Double Quotes around the entire text (quotes inside this description don't need to be escaped).

NOTE: for helping to find the latitude and longitude, we have a helper marker commented in `js/map.js`. Uncomment it to easily get coordinates from the map by dragging a simple marker.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TaylorHo/rpg-interactive-map.git
   cd rpg-interactive-map
   ```

2. Check the `variables.js` file, there's many available configurations.

3. Place your converted/splitted map into `map/` folder.

4. Add your marker data to the CSV file `locations.csv`

5. Host your map into GitHub Pages, Vercel, S3 or Cloudflare Pages (or any other static pages hosting service).
    - For running locally, you can use a tool like `serve` (install with `npm i -g serve`), running in the root folder the command `serve .`.

## Acknowledgments

- Dynamic loading of markers from a CSV file.
- Added sidebar functionality for location details.

The map used in this project is the one from Brzam's example.
